# geojson-web-viewer

This is a tiny web page template for displaying GeoJSON paths in a mobile browser.

### Why?

I use geojson.io to draw and update maps of hiking routes, places I've walked, and areas to explore. I often store them as [GitHub gists](https://gist.github.com), but it's hard to look at the maps when you're on the go. This mobile web viewer changes that!

### What does it do?

`index.html` loads a live GeoJSON file from the web and displays it on top of a Mapbox base map. That's about it. You can pan, zoom, etc.

For now it's hard-coded to a particular file of mine. Feel free to fork this repository and edit the code to host your own map.
